# Private AI Training

A revolutionary decentralized platform for confidential machine learning using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) smart contracts.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence
Private AI Training leverages cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology to enable machine learning on encrypted data. This groundbreaking approach ensures that sensitive training data remains private throughout the entire learning process while still allowing for collaborative model development.

### Confidential Machine Learning
Our platform implements a novel approach to AI training where:
- **Data Privacy**: All training data is encrypted at the source and remains encrypted throughout the computation
- **Model Confidentiality**: Neural network weights and biases are protected using FHE encryption
- **Secure Aggregation**: Multiple participants can contribute data without revealing individual inputs
- **Verifiable Training**: Blockchain technology ensures transparent and auditable AI model development

### Decentralized Training Network
The system creates a trustless environment where:
- Multiple parties can collaborate on AI model training without exposing their private data
- Contributors are rewarded for providing quality training data
- Model accuracy and training progress are transparently tracked on-chain
- Authorization mechanisms ensure only approved trainers can create and manage models

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Encrypted Neural Networks**: Complete model training using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
- **Privacy-Preserving Data Contribution**: Submit training data that remains encrypted end-to-end
- **Decentralized Reward System**: Earn rewards for contributing valuable training data
- **Transparent Model Management**: Track model accuracy, training rounds, and performance metrics
- **Authorization Controls**: Secure trainer approval and access management
- **Real-time Training Sessions**: Live monitoring of collaborative training progress
